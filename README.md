## Calories and Macronutrients
     
According to MyFitnessPal, one gram of Babes Chicken has 160 calories, 8 grams of

fat,
 0 grams of carbs, and 22 grams of protein. This means that a typical serving size of 4 ounces (113 grams) of Babes Chicken would have 181 calories, 9 grams of 
fat,
 0 grams of carbs, and 25 grams of protein. However, this does not include the calories from the breading, 
oil,
 or sauces that are used to prepare and serve the chicken.     
The breading adds extra carbs and calories to the chicken, while the oil adds more fat and calories. The sauces, such as gravy, honey mustard, or barbecue sauce, also add more carbs, sugar,

fat,

 and calories to the chicken. Depending on the type and amount of breading, 
oil,
 and sauce you choose, you could be adding anywhere from 50 to 300 extra calories to your chicken serving.     
For example, according to FatSecret, one small chicken back with breading and oil has 328 calories, 23 grams of

fat,
 0 grams of carbs, and 28 grams of protein. One small chicken breast with breading and oil has 364 calories, 16 grams of 
fat,
 15 grams of carbs, and 37 grams of protein. One small chicken thigh with breading and oil has 287 calories, 19 grams of 
fat,
 10 grams of carbs, and 21 grams of protein.     
As you can see, the breading and oil add a significant amount of calories and fat to the chicken. The sauces also vary in their nutritional content. For example, according to FatSecret, one tablespoon of gravy has 31 calories, 2 grams of

fat,
 3 grams of carbs, and 1 gram of protein. One tablespoon of honey mustard has 45 calories, 3 grams of 
fat,
 5 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of protein. One tablespoon of barbecue sauce has 29 calories, 0 grams of 
fat,
 7 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of protein.     
Therefore, if you want to reduce the calories and fat from your Babes Chicken meal, you should opt for leaner cuts of chicken (such as breast or wing), skip the breading or choose a lighter coating (such as cornmeal or flour), use less oil or choose a healthier oil (such as olive or canola), and limit the amount and type of sauce you use (or choose a lower-calorie sauce such as salsa or vinegar).
     
## Micronutrients and Other Benefits
     
Babes Chicken is a good source of protein, which is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, repairing tissues, and supporting immune function. Protein also helps you feel full and satisfied after a meal. Babes Chicken also provides some iron, zinc, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 from the chicken meat. These nutrients are important for blood production, metabolism, antioxidant defense,

bone health,
 energy production, and nerve function.     
However, Babes Chicken is also high in

sodium,
 
cholesterol,
 and saturated fat from the chicken skin, breading, 
oil,
 
and sauces. These nutrients can increase your risk of high blood pressure,
 
heart disease,
 
and stroke if consumed in excess. Babes Chicken also lacks fiber,
 
vitamin A,
 
vitamin C,
 
calcium,
 
and potassium from fruits,

vegetables,
 
and dairy products. These nutrients are essential for digestion,
 
vision,
 
skin health,
 
bone health,
 
and muscle function.
 
Therefore,

if you want to balance your Babes Chicken meal with more micronutrients and other benefits,
 
you should include some fruits,

vegetables,
 
and dairy products on your plate. For example,
 
you could have a salad with leafy greens,
 
tomatoes,
 
carrots,
 
and low-fat dressing; a baked potato with low-fat sour cream and chives; a fruit cup with berries,
 
melon,
 
and yogurt; or a glass of low-fat milk or water. These foods will add more fiber,
 
vitamins,
 
minerals,
 
and antioxidants to your meal without adding too many calories or fat.
 
## Conclusion
 
Babes Chicken is a delicious and satisfying meal that can provide you with plenty of protein and some other nutrients. However,

it can also be high in calories,
 
fat,
 
sodium,
 
cholesterol,
 
and saturated fat if you are not careful with your choices. To make your Babes Chicken meal more nutritious and balanced,
 
you should opt for leaner cuts of chicken,
 skip or reduce the breading and 
oil,
 
limit the amount and type of sauce you use,
 
and include some fruits,

vegetables,
 
and dairy products on your plate. By following these tips,
 
you can enjoy Babes Chicken without compromising your health or your waistline.
